![Architecture diagram showing how the 1102tools Claude Skills connect. SOW/PWS Builder feeds three IGCE Builders (FFP, LH/T&M, Cost-Reimbursement) which pull from BLS OEWS, GSA CALC+, and GSA Per Diem APIs. Also in the collection: Market Research Builder uses USASpending, Grants Builder uses BLS OEWS and Per Diem, Vendor Intelligence uses SAM.gov, USASpending, and eCFR, and Regulatory Intelligence uses Federal Register, eCFR, and Regulations.gov.](docs/architecture.png)

> **Before you build:** Not every acquisition capability should be an AI tool. Dozens of potential skills were evaluated and several were intentionally excluded. Some are planned and coming. Others will never be built because they cross the line from data assembly into professional judgment -- the kind of output that would not survive a protest, would not be adopted by the workforce, and would not be worth the time to develop. Read **[AI-BOUNDARIES.md](AI-BOUNDARIES.md)** for the full reasoning. It will save you development time and your users the backlash.

## What's Not Here

If you're looking for a capability that doesn't exist in this collection, there are two possible reasons: it's planned, or it was evaluated and deliberately excluded. Proposal scoring, best value tradeoff analysis, responsibility determinations, negotiation strategy, OCI analysis, and several other capabilities were considered and rejected because they require warrant-level judgment that AI cannot replicate and the acquisition workforce will not accept. See **[AI-BOUNDARIES.md](AI-BOUNDARIES.md)** for the complete list and the reasoning behind each decision.
