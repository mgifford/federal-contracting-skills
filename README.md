Right: Other Transactions where OT Project Description Builder feeds OT Cost Analysis (milestone-based pricing under 10 USC 4021/4022). Both chains pull from shared API data sources: BLS OEWS, GSA CALC+, and GSA Per Diem. Also in the collection: Market Research Builder, Grants Builder, Vendor Intelligence, and Award Review.](docs/architecture.png)

> **Before you build:** Not every acquisition capability should be an AI tool. Dozens of potential skills were evaluated and several were intentionally excluded. Some are planned and coming. Others will never be built because they cross the line from data assembly into professional judgment -- the kind of output that would not survive a protest, would not be adopted by the workforce, and would not be worth the time to develop. Read **[AI-BOUNDARIES.md](AI-BOUNDARIES.md)** for the full reasoning. It will save you development time and your users the backlash.

## What's Not Here

If you're looking for a capability that doesn't exist in this collection, there are two possible reasons: it's planned, or it was evaluated and deliberately excluded. Proposal scoring, best value tradeoff analysis, responsibility determinations, negotiation strategy, OCI analysis, and several other capabilities were considered and rejected because they require warrant-level judgment that AI cannot replicate and the acquisition workforce will not accept. See **[AI-BOUNDARIES.md](AI-BOUNDARIES.md)** for the complete list and the reasoning behind each decision.
