## 2. Composite Workflows

### Enrich Contract Court / PRISM Descriptions

Problem: PRISM overwrites the description field with the latest modification text.

```python
def get_base_description(piid):
    """Get the original base award description for a PIID."""
    award_types = detect_award_type(piid)
    result = search_awards(piid, award_types,
                           fields=["Award ID", "Description", "Award Amount",
                                   "Recipient Name", "generated_internal_id"])
    awards = result.get('results', [])
    if not awards and 'IDV' not in str(award_types):
        award_types = ["IDV_A","IDV_B","IDV_B_A","IDV_B_B","IDV_B_C","IDV_C","IDV_D","IDV_E"]
        result = search_awards(piid, award_types,
                               fields=["Award ID", "Description", "Award Amount",
                                        "Recipient Name", "generated_internal_id"])
        awards = result.get('results', [])
    return awards[0] if awards else None
```

### Batch PIID Lookup

```python
import time

def batch_lookup_descriptions(piids):
    """Look up base descriptions for a list of PIIDs."""
    results = {}
    for piid in piids:
        try:
            award = get_base_description(piid)
            if award:
                results[piid] = {'description': award.get('Description'),
                    'amount': award.get('Award Amount'),
                    'recipient': award.get('Recipient Name'),
                    'internal_id': award.get('generated_internal_id')}
            else:
                results[piid] = None
        except Exception as e:
            results[piid] = {'error': str(e)}
        time.sleep(0.3)
    return results
```

### Get Full Award Lifecycle

```python
def get_award_lifecycle(piid):
    """Get complete award info: base description + all modifications."""
    award = get_base_description(piid)
    if not award:
        return None
    internal_id = award.get('generated_internal_id')
    detail = get_award_detail(internal_id)
    transactions = get_transactions(internal_id, limit=100)
    return {'award': detail, 'transactions': transactions.get('results', [])}
```

### Dimensional Analysis with Award Counts

```python
# Count FFP awards
ffp_filters = {**base_filters, "contract_pricing_type_codes": ["J"]}
ffp_count = get_award_counts(ffp_filters)["results"]["contracts"]

# Count competed awards
comp_filters = {**base_filters, "extent_competed_type_codes": ["A","D","F","CDO"]}
comp_count = get_award_counts(comp_filters)["results"]["contracts"]

# Count small business set-aside awards
sb_filters = {**base_filters, "set_aside_type_codes": ["SBA","SBP","8A","8AN"]}
sb_count = get_award_counts(sb_filters)["results"]["contracts"]
```

### Top Small Business Vendors

```python
sb_vendor_filters = {**base_filters, "set_aside_type_codes": ["SBA","SBP","8A","8AN","HZC","HZS","SDVOSBS","SDVOSBC","WOSB","WOSBSS","EDWOSB","EDWOSBSS","VSA"]}
sb_vendors = spending_by_category("recipient", sb_vendor_filters, limit=15)
```

## 3. Bulk Download

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v2/bulk_download/awards/`

Async: returns download URL. Uses DIFFERENT filter structure than search endpoints.

```python
def request_bulk_download(filters):
    payload = json.dumps({"filters": filters, "columns": [], "file_format": "csv"})
    url = "https://api.usaspending.gov/api/v2/bulk_download/awards/"
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, data=payload.encode('utf-8'),
                                 headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'})
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=30) as resp:
        return json.loads(resp.read().decode())
```

Key differences from search filters:
- `"prime_award_types"` instead of `"award_type_codes"`
- `"date_range": {"start_date": "...", "end_date": "..."}` (object) instead of `"time_period"` (array)
- Requires `"date_type"` field (e.g., `"action_date"`)

---

## 4. Loan Search

Loans use different field names. "Award Amount" returns HTTP 400; use "Loan Value".

```python
def search_loans(keywords, limit=10):
    payload = json.dumps({
        "subawards": False, "limit": min(limit, 100), "page": 1,
        "sort": "Loan Value", "order": "desc",
        "filters": {
            "keywords": keywords if isinstance(keywords, list) else [keywords],
            "award_type_codes": ["07", "08"]
        },
        "fields": ["Award ID", "Recipient Name", "Recipient UEI", "Description",
                    "Loan Value", "Subsidy Cost", "Awarding Agency", "Awarding Sub Agency",
                    "generated_internal_id", "Last Modified Date"]
    })
    url = "https://api.usaspending.gov/api/v2/search/spending_by_award/"
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, data=payload.encode('utf-8'),
                                 headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'})
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=15) as resp:
        return json.loads(resp.read().decode())
```

---

## 5. Award Funding (File C Data)

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v2/awards/funding/`

Federal account, object class, and program activity data linked to an award.

```python
def get_award_funding(generated_award_id):
    payload = json.dumps({"award_id": generated_award_id, "limit": 50, "page": 1})
    url = "https://api.usaspending.gov/api/v2/awards/funding/"
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, data=payload.encode('utf-8'),
                                 headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'})
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=15) as resp:
        return json.loads(resp.read().decode())
```

Sort fields: reporting_fiscal_date, account_title, transaction_obligated_amount, object_class.

---

## 6. Reference Endpoints (GET)

## 8. Vendor Deduplication Notes

The `recipient` category returns results by unique entity (UEI). Large companies often appear multiple times due to subsidiaries, divisions, or re-registrations. When using for vendor landscape analysis:
- Vendor counts may overstate unique companies
- Market share may be split across multiple entries
- No built-in dedup; apply case-insensitive name matching if precision matters
- Name normalization catches suffix variations but not acquisitions/rebrands (e.g., Cerner to Oracle Health Government Services; Northrop Grumman acquired Peraton)
- Vendor names return in ALL CAPS; title-case for reports but preserve LLC/INC/LLP in uppercase

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 422 "award_type_codes must only contain types from one group" | Mixed contract + IDV codes | Separate into two requests |
| 422 "Invalid value in filters\|psc_codes" | Empty `"exclude": []` | Remove exclude key or use simple array |
| 422 "Field 'limit' value above max" | limit > 100 (search) or > 5000 (transactions) | Reduce limit; paginate |
| 400 "Sort value not found in requested fields" | Sort field not in fields array | Add sort field to fields |
| 400 "Sort value not found in Loan Award mappings" | "Award Amount" with loan codes | Use "Loan Value" for loans |
| 400 "Invalid value in filters\|keywords" | Empty keywords array | Omit keywords filter entirely |
| Empty results for known PIID | Wrong award type group | Try contracts then IDVs |
| Null values for valid fields | Typo in field name (API accepts anything) | Verify field spelling |
| Truncated description | FPDS 4000-char limit | Normal; use what's available |
| Stale data (non-DoD) | FPDS update lag | Non-DoD typically available within 5 business days |
| Stale data (DoD/USACE) | 90-day FPDS reporting delay | DoD and USACE procurement data has a 90-day lag; plan accordingly |
